Care should be taken to see that the load to be transmitted should be increased step by step by checking condition of tooth flank at regular intervals. Shortening the running in period by radical means will increase the danger of gear damage by removal of the gear material particles. Unlike priming process, the grease is applied though the automatic grease spraying system set at maximum output. Special attention to be paid when changing from one load step to next one. In case of abnormal flank damage reduce the load. During the running in process, it is perceived to achieve optimum surface finish on gear flanks which will enable them to transmit max power with minimum contact pressure imparted to the lubricating film.",
