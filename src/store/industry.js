With dropping points above 260ºC, this type of grease can withstand peak operating temperatures of up to 240ºC for short periods of time. Continuous temperatures of 150ºC should not present a problem for grease formulated with mineral oils; This excellent high temperature performance results from a high melting point coupled with the very dense fibre structure of the soap matrix. Very small polar fibres strongly bind the base lubricant providing excellent protection against oxidation due to low heat transfer throughout the matrix. CLG LC EP-2 is amber coloured Lithium Complex Grease based on highly refined heavy mineral oil and additives. The grease covers wide range operating service temperature from -20 to +1600 C.",

Care should be taken to see that the load to be transmitted should be increased step by step by checking condition of tooth flank at regular intervals. Shortening the running in period by radical means will increase the danger of gear damage by removal of the gear material particles. Unlike priming process, the grease is applied though the automatic grease spraying system set at maximum output. Special attention to be paid when changing from one load step to next one. In case of abnormal flank damage reduce the load. During the running in process, it is perceived to achieve optimum surface finish on gear flanks which will enable them to transmit max power with minimum contact pressure imparted to the lubricating film.

Performance expectations for lubricants used in offshore wind turbines are higher due to demand for extended life. The greases recommended for wind mills are generally made by using synthetic oils, Complex thickeners and special additives. The Lubricating greases should pass low temperature operability and EMCOR rust test under salty conditions.",
