                <p class="text-center fs-1 fw-bold p-2  text-capitalize">About CLG oil & greases</p>
                <p class="text-start">CLG Oil & Greases are high-performance lubricants specifically engineered to
                    address the unique needs of various engines and machinery. These products are developed through
                    rigorous field testing and advanced formulation techniques to ensure optimal performance. CLG Oil is
                    designed to significantly reduce engine wear, extend the lifespan of engine components, and increase
                    the intervals between oil changes. This results in superior protection and efficiency, making it a
                    reliable choice for maintaining engine health and performance.

            <div class="container my-5">
                <p class="text-center fs-1 fw-bold p-2 text-capitalize">Why Choose CLG oil & greases</p>
                <div class="row">
                    <p class="text-start col-md-6">
                        While many oils might seem similar at first glance, their performance can vary greatly. CLG Oil
                        & Greases are formulated to offer exceptional protection and efficiency that generic oils often
                        cannot match. Unlike standard oils that meet general performance standards such as API service
                        categories or IS specifications, CLG Oil exceeds these basic benchmarks. It is meticulously
                        tailored to meet the specific demands of different engines and equipment. This means enhanced
                        protection, reduced wear, and longer service intervals, which translates to fewer maintenance
                        issues and improved performance. Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) recommend CLG Oil due
                        to its superior formulation, which ensures reliability and longevity for their engines. This
                        specialized approach helps in reducing overall maintenance costs and achieving better engine
                        performance.
